## ✒️ General Information 
DeValiance is the first website I have ever created from scratch using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It is a static website that showcases real games I have created, and makes maximum use of all the different things I have learnt in the module. The project also consists of additional pages separated from the main website to learn Bootstrap and JavaScript.

<br/>

## ❤️ Motivation
The aim of this project was to learn the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a static website. DeValiance came to birth for a strong passion in indie game development and to have a platform to demonstrate some video games I have developed using the Unity Game Engine.
